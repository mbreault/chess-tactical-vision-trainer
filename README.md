Implementing a generator for this https://www.chess.com/article/view/improving-your-tactical-vision

It only does one move right now instead of the recommended two or more, but I wanted something to place a random piece in a random location and generate the valid moves.  This does that.

It will print the piece and location in the console and write the legal moves to a text file, moves.txt.  Write down all of the legal moves you can think of and then open the txt file and compare.  Primitive but effective.
